# WBC-Wreckage-Beyond-Control
2D Java Game using Open GL Rendering

This is by no means a perfect game! Far from it; it is actually pretty clunky and buggy.

But, it taught me a lot of things that no textbook could. I made this game in 10 days for a Game development competition,
and at the time, I had no prior experience with OpenGL. (Hence, the rather unusual name of the main package : OpenGL Experiments). I did not want to use any external engine for my own game wanted to build it from scratch. I took the brave decision of doing everything on my own. 

The decision gave me one of the toughest projects of my life. 10 days and 3000+ lines of Java code later, I can safely say that this was the most educative and satisfying.

I invite you to start by downloading the game from : https://github.com/shekavi/WBC-Wreckage-Beyond-Control/blob/master/WBC%20game.jar
The installation instruction(if required) is given in https://github.com/shekavi/WBC-Wreckage-Beyond-Control/blob/master/Install.txt
